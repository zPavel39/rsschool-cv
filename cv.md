## About Me:
I am studying Frontend development. I want to become a specialist in this field.
There is an opportunity to change my life, and I will not miss it.
I started studying on my own in January of this year. To test my knowledge, I decided to take courses.
At the moment I am taking 2 courses at the same time. I hope that extensive and time-consuming work will bear fruit.
***I am purposeful, self-study and learning in general are easy.*** I was familiar with programming from school and then at the institute.
I want to be a competent employee of the company that will accept me.
## Key skills:
 * HTML
 * CSS
 * Git
 * JavaScript
 * Sass

```javascript
function removeChar(str){
    if (str.length > 1) {
      return str.slice(1, str.length -1)
    } else {
        return str
    }
  };
```
## My first project for my friend, asked me to make a regular website (without JS)
